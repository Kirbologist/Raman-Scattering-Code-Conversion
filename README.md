# Raman-Scattering-Code-Conversion
C++ code written as part of the UQ SMP project "Efficient code for calculation of Raman scattering by spheroids"

Project supervisor is A/Prof Taras Plakhotnik.

## Introduction

The original MATLAB code was written to calculate Raman scattering by spheroids with arbitrary precision. The code uses the SMARTIES v1.01 MATLAB package, with some modifications made to support multiprecision using the Advanpix Multiprecision Toolbox. SMARTIES is an implementation of the T-matrix/Extended Boundary-Condition Method for light-scattering by spheroids, with the modified code lent to me by Plakhotnik. The goal of the project is to rewrite the code that was used for the calculation of Raman scattering in a more efficient compiled programming language that has numeric computation and scientific computing support. Hopefully this will accelerate the computation speeds by orders of magnitude and allow calculations for larger spheroids using higher precision.

## Notable differences from smarties

- Expansion coefficients and other arrays that store using p-indices now include values for when n=0, m=0. This makes P (the length of the p-vectors) (N+1)^2. Functions that are affected by this include:
  - vshPinmTaunm
  - vshGetIncidentCoeffs
- Functions that take 'scheme/mode' argument of type string now take them as enum types instead. This causes these functions to theoretically behave slightly differently for non-standard values of the 'scheme/mode' argument, although such behaviour shouldn't be able to manifest at compile-time. Functions that are affected by this include:
  - auxPrepareIntegrals
  - vshMakeIncidentParams

## Dependencies

- Eigen 3.4.0, a free, open-source, efficient and comprehensive linear algebra library made for C++. Website: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php
- Boost (C++ Libraries) 1.77.0, a free, open-source set of libraries with applications in a wide variety of areas. Currently only used for some special mathematical functions. Website: https://www.boost.org
- The GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library (GNU MPFR), a C library that provides support for arbitrary-precision floating-point computation. Website: https://www.mpfr.org

## Notes

- Although most of the code is based on the SMARTIES v1.01 MATLAB package, only the functions necessary for calculating Raman scattering will be converted.
- The coding style is loosely based on Google's C++ style guide, with variable, struct and function names matching closely with the ones given in the original SMARTIES code.
- The code was written to be compiled with G++ and on hardware that correctly implements the IEEE 754 standard. If IEEE 754 is not supported, compiling or executing the code may cause a divide-by-zero hardware exception.
