# Raman-Scattering-Code-Conversion
C++ code written as part of the UQ SMP project "Efficient code for calculation of Raman scattering by spheroids"

Author is Siwan Li

Project supervisor is A/Prof Taras Plakhotnik.

## Introduction

The original MATLAB code was written to calculate Raman scattering by spheroids with arbitrary precision. The original code (shared with me by T. Plakhotnik) uses the SMARTIES v1.01 MATLAB package, with some modifications made to support arbitrary precision using the Advanpix Multiprecision Toolbox. SMARTIES is an implementation of the T-matrix/Extended Boundary-Condition Method for light-scattering by spheroids. The goal of the project is to rewrite the code that was used for the calculation of Raman scattering in a more efficient compiled programming language that can support numerical computation. Hopefully this will accelerate the computation speeds by orders of magnitude and allow calculations for larger spheroids using higher precision.

## Progress

  - [x] aux* functions (2/2)
  - [x] vsh* functions (9/9)
  - [x] sph* functions (11/11)
  - [x] rvh* functions (5/3)
  - [x] slv* functions (2/2)
  - [x] pst* functions (2/2)
  - [x] Non-SMARTIES functions (2/2)
  - [x] Minimum viable product
  - [ ] arbitrary-precision support
  - [ ] parallel computing support

## Notable differences from SMARTIES

- Expansion coefficients and other arrays that store using p-indices now include values for when n=0, m=0. This makes P (the length of the p-vectors) equal to (N+1)^2 and makes the code more convenient in a index-by-zero language without compromising any calculations. As a side effect, many other functions that calculate values for various values n are affected as well. Functions that are affected by this include the following. (Note that in almost all cases, the extra values are 0, so they act as padding.)
  - vshPinmTaunm
  - vshGetIncidentCoeffs
  - vshEgenThetaAllPhi
  - vshGetZnAll
  - sphGetBesselProductsPrimes
  - sphGetModifiedBesselProducts
  - sphCalculatePQ
  - rvhGetFieldCoefficients
  - pstScatteringMatrixOA
- Functions that take an argument of type string (for specifying method of calculation) now take them as enum types instead. This causes these functions to theoretically behave slightly differently for unexpected values of the argument, although such behaviour shouldn't be able to manifest at compile-time. Functions that are affected by this include:
  - auxPrepareIntegrals
  - vshMakeIncidentParams
  - vshEgenThetaAllPhi
  - vshGetZnAll
- Some structs that originally contained [1 x X] matrix members may now contain [X x 1] matrix members instead for slightly better syntax. Structs that have this include (but are not limited to):
  - stAbcdnm
- Currently, auxPrepareIntegrals doesn't read from any pre-calculated values when preparing integrals.
- sphCalculatePQ doesn't try to access stParams.output, since stParams is expected to be the same struct type as the one given in the specification, in which case output is not a member of stParams. Such a member does exist in stOptions however, so future implementations may take stOptions as an argument type. (For calculating Raman scattering, this option is true by default.)
- The slvGetOptionsFromStruct function cannot be called on its own and is instead implemented into the stOptions constructors.
- The pstMakeStructForField function currently puts stIncPar into returning struct stRes by using std::move(); this means that the stIncPar will be made empty after pstMakeStructForField is used. This is done, since in the final program, the input stIncPar doesn't need to be kept.
- sphEstimateDelta doesn't get called in slvForT in the final program for this, so this function isn't implemented.
- rvhGetSymmetricMat is not debugged since it's never used in the final raman_elastic_scattering program.
- rvhTruncateMatrices, rvhGetSymmetricMat, rvhGetFieldCoefficients, rvhGetAverageCrossSections can only take stTR vectors as arguments and not stPR vectors. (Overloading these functions with versions that can take stPR vectors is relatively simple however.)

## Dependencies

- Eigen 3.4.0, a free, open-source, efficient and comprehensive linear algebra library made for C++. Website: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php
- Boost (C++ Libraries) 1.77.0, a free, open-source set of libraries with applications in a wide variety of areas. Currently only used for some special mathematical functions. Website: https://www.boost.org
- The GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library (GNU MPFR), a C library that provides support for arbitrary-precision floating-point computation. Website: https://www.mpfr.org

## Notes

- Although most of the code is based on the SMARTIES v1.01 MATLAB package, only the functions necessary for calculating Raman scattering will be converted.
- The coding style is loosely based on Google's C++ style guide, with variable, struct and function names matching closely with the ones given in the original SMARTIES code.
- The code was written to be compiled with G++ and on hardware that correctly implements the IEEE 754 standard. If IEEE 754 is not supported, compiling or executing the code may cause a divide-by-zero hardware exception.
